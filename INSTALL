====== BINARY INSTALL ======
I have built ppc/i386 32 bit libraries for Amira 5.2.2 with MacOS X 10.5.8 and gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493).  This includes the core teem/nrrd libraries.

To install, copy the library files (.dylib) and the resource files (.rc) into: 

  /Applications/Amira-5.2.2/lib/arch-MacX-Optimize
  /Applications/Amira-5.2.2/share/resources

respectively.

====== BUILDING FROM SOURCE ======
Although everything should work on Linux or Windows, my only experience is with Mac.

===== Mac Setup =====
1) AmiraDev 5.2.2
2) Apple's Xcode >=3.1
3) Cmake >= 2.4
4) teem >= 1.10.0 (http://teem.sourceforge.net/)

===== Build teem =====
1) follow teem's cmake installation build instructions. Basically
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ccmake .. # to configure, see 2 below
  make 
2) Make sure you build shared libraries (you can choose to in ccmake)
3) install into /usr/local/teem (the default)

===== Build hxNrrdIO =====
1) Make an Amira local directory using the Development Wizard 
2) git clone the hxNrrdIO repository into the src subdir (or extract a tar ball):
  git cpu
3) make the build files using the Development Wizard 
4) Build with:
  make MAKE_CFG=Optimize
5) Restart Amira to test
