====== Intro ======
This is a simple library to allow the Amira 3d visualisation software:
	http://www.amiravis.com/
to read data in the Nrrd (Nearly Raw Raster Data) format:
	http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.

====== Limitations ======
  * VERY LIMITED TESTING SO FAR!
  * Currently only reads 3d (scalar) and 4d (vector) fields
  * Only writes 3d data 

====== History ======
  * v0.1 - first release

====== License ======
  * Currently GPL >=3 but I hope to change this to something probably more appropriate (eg LGPL 2) in due course.
